## Description
Using data from a dataset containing 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia to train multiple models. The goal is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in different regions. Advanced methods are also applied to improve the accuracy.

## Technology
- Data Preprocessing (Imputation, Scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization
- Machine Learning Models:
  - K-Means
  - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Logistic Regression
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
  - FNN (Feedforward Neural Network)
- Evaluation Metrics

## Features
- Data preprocessing for handling missing values and scaling
- Exploratory data analysis for understanding the data
- Visualization of data and model results
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models
- Prediction of rain occurrence with improved accuracy

## How to Use
1. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
3. Visualize the data and results.
4. Train and evaluate the machine learning models.
5. Use the best-performing model to predict rain occurrence.
